# ThemeLab
ThemeLab is a simple easy to use script that allows you to create a custom themed kik.

# Download 
Current Release : Public Beta 1


# What is supported?
1. Custom Primary/Secondary Theme Colors
2. Custom Login Background
3. Custom Conversation List Background
4. Custom App Name
5. Add your username to the login screen

# How to use it?
1. Download ThemeLab.zip from the above link
2. Extract the zip to a directory of your choice
3. Double Click ThemeLab.bat, follow the onscreen prompts
4. Do NOT use another apk, use the provided base.apk (this script will only work with that exact apk, we will support
regular stock kik soon)
4. Users with IOBit Malware Fighter may need to temporarily disable it in order to run the script
(it's some sort of a file-permission bug with IOBit Malware Fighter)

# Planned Updates
1. No longer rely on small scripts, everything will be compiled into a singular
self extracting .exe
2. Support stock kik (this will take a decent amount of work, and it will be specific to whatever kik version)
(what i mean is i'll have to make a script for each version of kik, so i'm only supporting kik 14.9 and above)
3. Custom Settings Background (this is easy to implement i just need to fix a few bugs)
4. Custom Package Name (i have a package changer script available in another repository, i just need to properly
integrate it with ThemeLab)
